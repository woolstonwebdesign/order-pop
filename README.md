== Description ==
This plugin presents a notification to users announcing purchases made by other customers.
Order Pop requires Woocommerce to function.
This is a proven marketing approach that encourages customers to purchase products that appear to be desirable by previous customers.
This plugin allows you to configure:
* start/stop all notifications
* the pop background colour
* the pop text colour
* how many previously completed orders to draw from (this lets you target recent orders or those completed long ago)
* how often products should refresh within the pop
* how long a customer can dismiss pops for

== Installation ==
1. In your admin panel, go to Plugins and find the 'Order Pop' plugin
2. Click on the ‘Activate’ button to start using Order Pop.
3. Navigate to Order Pop in your admin panel and customize. (Pops are turned off by default)
