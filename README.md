== Description ==
Order Pop presents a notification to users announcing purchases made by other customers.
Order Pop requires Woocommerce to function.
This is a proven marketing approach that encourages customers to purchase products that appear to be desirable by previous customers.
This plugin allows you to configure:
* start/stop all notifications
* the pop background colour
* the pop text colour
* how many previously completed orders to draw from (this lets you target recent orders or those completed long ago)
* how often products should refresh within the pop
* how long a customer can dismiss pops for

== Installation ==
1. In your admin panel, go to Plugins and find the 'Order Pop' plugin
2. Click on the ‘Activate’ button to start using Order Pop.
3. Navigate to Order Pop in your admin panel and customize. (Pops are turned off by default)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need to have Woocommerce for Order Pop to work? =
Yes, Order Pop pulls from Woocommerce's order history and displays content based on those sales.

= Do you store my data away from my site? =
No, Order Pop does not store your data outside of your Wordpress instance. The only time we use your data outside of Wordpress is when it gets pushed to the customer's browser and stored there for quick and performant retrieval.

Not at all. Order Pop is free. There is a Pro version which is available at https://www.woolston.com.au/product/order-pop-wordpress-plugin/.
