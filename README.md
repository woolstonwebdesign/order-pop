# Order Pop Sales Notification
This plugin presents a notification to users announcing purchases made by other customers.
This is a proven marketing approach that encourages customers to purchase products that appear to be desirable by previous customers.
This plugin allows you to configure:
* start/stop all notifications
* the pop background colour
* the pop text colour
* how many previously completed orders to draw from (this lets you target recent orders or those completed long ago)
* how often products should refresh within the pop
* how long a customer can dismiss pops for
