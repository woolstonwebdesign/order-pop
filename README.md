# Order Pop Sales Notification

Order Pop is a notification that creates FOMO (fear of missing out) in your customers and drives sales.

## Description
Order Pop presents a notification to users announcing purchases made by other customers. Order Pop requires Woocommerce to function.

This is a proven marketing approach that encourages customers to purchase products that appear to be desirable by previous customers.
This plugin allows you to configure:
* start/stop all notifications
* the pop background colour
* the pop text colour
* how many previously completed orders to draw from (this lets you target recent orders or those completed long ago)
* how often products should refresh within the pop
* how long a customer can dismiss pops for

Order Pop does not store your data outside your Wordpress instance. Order Pop calls the Woocommerce order history and pulls content that matches your configuration criteria (see screenshots for more information). Order Pop then caches that content for around 10 minutes to improve performance, but that cache is cleared and rebuilt when changes are saved in the Order Pop admin screen.
